/**
 * Ticking a task by pressing its box.
 *
 * The box is a pseudo-element drawn from the item's `data-checked` attribute,
 * so there is nothing to attach a handler to and nothing for a click to land
 * on: a press went through to the text and put the caret there instead. Ticking
 * an item was only possible by retyping `[x] ` at the head of it, which is not
 * something anybody would guess.
 *
 * A pseudo-element's clicks are reported against the element that owns it, so
 * the item itself is the target and the only question is whether the press was
 * in the box or in the words. That is a matter of where it landed, and the box
 * is drawn to the left of the item's content, so the answer is the geometry.
