/**
 * Fuzzy matching and ranking for quick open.
 *
 * An fzf-shaped subsequence scorer: it rewards consecutive runs, word
 * boundaries, camelCase humps and an exact prefix, and lightly penalises a wide
 * match span and a long tail. Ported from the author's `fuzzy-search` Typora
 * plugin, whose weightings are the ones his muscle memory is tuned to.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately in shared code rather than in main: ranking happens in
 * the renderer on every keystroke, and a round trip per character is the one
 * thing that would make a search box feel slow. Main sends the index once and
 * the renderer does the arithmetic.
 *
 * Matching is a code-unit subsequence over lowercased text, which is CJK safe
 * as it stands: Han characters are in the BMP and are unaffected by case
 * folding, so a query in Chinese matches the same way one in English does.
 *
 * A space is AND of such subsequences, the way `fzf --filter` treats one. The
 * in-process scorer used to demand the space itself appear in the name, so
 * `open jobs` missed `openjobs.md` while the Typora plugin (with fzf on PATH)
 * found it. Quoted phrases stay one term.
