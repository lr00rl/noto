/**
 * Searching inside the notes, rather than across their names.
 *
 * Scanned on demand, with no index and no external binary. Both of those were
 * considered and both cost more than they return here. An inverted index over
 * this vault means holding tens of megabytes of text in the main process and
 * then owning its invalidation, for a query that already answers in a quarter
 * of a second. Shelling out to ripgrep means the feature works on machines that
 * happen to have it and silently does not on the rest; the grammar still
 * follows rg's default (every word must appear, `re:` for an expression) so
 * the box feels like the Typora plugin without making the binary a
 * requirement. A plugin that wants the real `rg` can own that later.
 *
 * Measured on the author's vault, 7,066 notes and 82.5 MB of markdown: a full
 * scan takes about 1.3 seconds cold and 274 ms once the operating system has
 * the files cached, which is what a debounce is for.
 *
 * Reads are concurrent and bounded. Reading seven thousand files one at a time
 * on the main process would hold the event loop for the whole scan, which is
 * the window freezing; a bounded pool keeps it responsive and is also faster,
 * because the cost here is waiting for the disk rather than doing arithmetic.
