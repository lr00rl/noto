/**
 * Taking a note out of the vault as something other than markdown.
 *
 * Two different jobs wearing one menu. The document formats, Word and the rest,
 * are a conversion of the markdown, and Pandoc does them from the file on disk:
 * the note is the source of truth and converting the source rather than the
 * screen keeps a heading a heading rather than a run of styled text. PDF and
 * HTML are the opposite: what they are for is the document as Noto draws it, so
 * they come from the renderer's own HTML and its own stylesheet.
 *
 * This file owns the Pandoc job and the naming for both. The decisions are pure
 * and tested; the one impure part is the same `execFile` the import uses, with
 * an argument array and no shell. Labels and writers live in shared so the
 * command palette names the same things the menu does.
