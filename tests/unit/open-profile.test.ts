/**
 * Splits the open path into its phases, on demand.
 *
 * Noto loses to Typora at half a megabyte, and "the double parse" was the
 * suspected cause, but that phrase covers three different jobs: scanning text
 * into block spans, producing mdast, and building ProseMirror nodes. Optimising
 * the wrong one is the usual way this goes wrong, so this measures them apart.
 *
 * In the app the renderer `splitBlocks` phase now runs inside a module Worker
 * so it no longer freezes the UI thread; this profile still times the same
 * work on the test thread, because the cost of the parse itself is what we
 * need when comparing sizes, not which thread paid it.
 *
 * Skipped by default because it is a measurement, not an assertion, and it
 * needs the generated corpus. Run it with:
 *
 *     PROFILE_OPEN=1 pnpm vitest run tests/unit/open-profile.test.ts
